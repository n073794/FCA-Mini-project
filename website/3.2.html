<h4>3.2 Correlation Between Gender and Post-Degree Choices</h4>
<p align="justify">This section analyzes the relationship between gender and the students’ decisions regarding their educational and career aspirations, specifically focusing on two aspects, their interest in pursuing further education after completing their current degree and their intent to work in the same field as their current degree.
    <br>The analysis categorizes students into three groups based on their interest in pursuing further education (“Yes”, “Maybe” and “No”) and their intent to work in the same field (“Yes”, “Maybe” and “No”). This allows us to identify trends and insights into how gender influences their interest in further education and intent to work in the same field.
    <br>
    To explore this topic, the following questions from the survey were tackled:
    <br>•	Do you plan to work in the same field as your degree?
    <br>•	Do you intend to pursue further education
    <br>
    
    <br>
<table align="center" border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>What is your gender?</th>
            <th>Do you plan to work in the same field as your degree? YES</th>
            <th>Do you plan to work in the same field as your degree? MAYBE</th>
            <th>Do you plan to work in the same field as your degree? NO</th>
            <th>Do you intend to pursue further education? Yes</th>
            <th>Do you plan to work in the same field as your degree? Maybe</th>
            <th>Do you plan to work in the same field as your degree? No</th>

    <br>
    The function used to calculate data in this table is:
    <br>
    <br>•	COUNTIFS
    <br>
    The COUNTIFS function applies criteria to cells across multiple ranges and counts the number of times all criteria are met.[1]
    <br>
    The basic syntax of the COUNTIFS function is:
    <br>

<table border="1" align="center"><th>=COUNTIFS(criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2]…)</th></table><br>
    <center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Formula 9: Gender and Post-Degree Goals: COUNTIFS - Syntax</font></i></center><br>
    <br>
    The COUNTIFS function syntax has the following arguments:
    <br>
    <b>criteria_range1</b> (Required): The first range in which to evaluate the associated criteria.
    <br>
    <b>criteria1</b> (Required): The criteria in the form of a number, expression, cell reference, or text that define which cells will be counted. 
    <br>
    <b>criteria_range2, criteria2, ...</b> (Optional): Additional ranges and their associated criteria. Up to 127 range/criteria pairs are allowed.
    <br>
    Here, we use the COUNTIFS function to count the number of occurrences of distinct values in a row, based on multiple criteria: 
    <br>
    
    
<table border="1" align="center"><th>=COUNTIFS(A2:A57, M2, B2:B57, “Yes”)</th></table><br>
    <center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Formula 10: Gender and Post-Degree Goals: COUNTIFS - Example Usage</font></i></center><br>

     <table align="center" border="1">
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>B</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <th>What is your gender?</th>
            <th>Do you plan to work in the same field as your degree?</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Male</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Male</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>...</td>
        </tr>

    <br>
    When COUNTIFS function is applied to the range of cells - A2 to A57 & B2 to B57, it scans the range of cells and counts all values that satisfy the given criteria. Then the autofill feature is used to apply the same function across a whole column.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <th>Gender</th>
            <th>Do you plan to work in the same field as your degree? YES</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Male</td>
            <td>12</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>14</td>
        </tr>
    </table><br>
    <center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Table 12: Gender and Post-Degree Goals: COUNTIFS – After</font></i></center><br>
    <br>
    The values are then displayed as the output in a new column or row depending on how the function is applied. Here the values are displayed in the new column N. The rest of the table was completed using the auto-fill feature.
    <br>
    The COUNTIFS function is used here as it applies criteria to cells across multiple ranges and counts the number of times all criteria are met. This allows us to count responses which fulfill multiple criteria, which are in this case gender and response type.

    <br>
    The <b>clustered column chart</b> type was chosen for both charts because it provides a clear and intuitive way to compare values across different categories, making the data easier to interpret.
