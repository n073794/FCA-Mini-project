<h4>4.3 Correlation Between Gender and External Influences</h4>
<h5> 4.3.1 External Influence and Degree Choice </h5>

<p align="justify">
    The data reveals a distinct gender-based pattern on the influence of others on degree choice. A greater proportion of female respondents were influenced by others in their degree choice. This trend indicates that females are more receptive of outside influence for their degree choice. On the other hand, males were more likely to respond with "No," suggesting that they are relatively less inclined to be influenced by recommendations
<br> <br>
When it comes to considering alternative degree programs, the responses follow the same trend as the earlier question. Female respondents were more likely to explore other options, suggesting greater openness or flexibility in their academic choices, possibly influenced by factors like career alignment or external guidance. Male respondents, in contrast, showed less inclination to reconsider their degree choices, indicating stronger confidence or commitment to their initial selection.
