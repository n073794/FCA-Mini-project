<center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Figure 11: Inference - 100% Stacked Bar Chart - Gender and Further Education</font></i></center><br>
<p align="justify">
    The data reveals a distinct gender-based pattern in the decision to pursue further education. A greater proportion of female respondents expressed a definite interest in pursuing higher studies compared to their male counterparts. This trend indicates that females tend to view further education as an important step for career advancement or personal growth. On the other hand, males were more likely to respond with "Maybe" or "No," suggesting that they are relatively less inclined toward further academic pursuits. This may reflect an eagerness among male students to enter the workforce sooner or pursue alternative career pathways.

<h5> 4.2.2 Working in the Same Field</h5>

<center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Figure 12: Inference - 100% Stacked Bar Chart - Gender and Field of Work</font></i></center><br>

<p align="justify">
    When it comes to plans for working in the same field as their degree, the responses from both genders were more evenly distributed. However, females were slightly more likely to give a definitive "Yes" than males, demonstrating a stronger inclination to align their career with their educational background. Males, on the other hand, leaned more toward "Maybe," suggesting flexibility or uncertainty in committing to a career directly tied to their degree.

<h5> 4.2.3 Insights</h5>

<p align="justify">
    This analysis highlights key gender differences in career and educational priorities. Female respondents appear to adopt a more structured approach to their academic and professional goals, emphasizing further education and consistency in their field of study. In contrast, male respondents display greater openness to exploring diverse career paths or entering the job market without additional qualifications.
