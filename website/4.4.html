<h4>4.4 Correlation Between Confidence and Personal Interest</h4>

<center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Figure 15: Inference - Bar Chart – Personal Interest and Confidence Levels</font></i></center><br>
<h5> 4.4.1 Confidence and Personal Interest </h5>
<p align="justify">
    The data suggests a strong correlation between confidence levels and choosing a degree based on personal interest. Respondents who selected their degree based on personal interest tend to exhibit higher confidence levels. For instance:
<br>•	At confidence levels <b>9 and 10</b>, a significant majority of students chose their degree based on personal interest (10 and 14 respondents, respectively), with few or no respondents who did not base their choice on personal interest.
<br><br>Conversely, those who did not choose their degree based on personal interest generally report lower confidence levels. For example:
<br>•	At confidence levels <b>5 and 6</b>, no respondents or only a few (0 and 4, respectively) reported not basing their choice on personal interest.
<br><br>This trend highlights the positive impact of aligning degree choices with personal interests on students' confidence in their academic and career paths. Encouraging students to pursue degrees aligned with their passions could foster greater confidence and engagement.

<h5> 4.4.2 Insights </h5>
<p align="justify">
    Students who chose their degree based on personal interest exhibit higher confidence levels, particularly at levels 9 and 10. In contrast, those who did not base their choice on personal interest show lower confidence, with no respondents reaching the highest levels. This highlights the importance of aligning degree choices with personal passions to boost confidence and career assurance.
