<h3>1.3 Contributions</h3><br>
<h5>Suraiya Fathima:</h5>
<p align="justify">In this project, my main contributions were centered around analyzing skill alignment,
active skill development, and the relationship between personal interest and career readiness. I worked on understanding how students feel about the alignment of their skills with their current degree. By categorizing the responses based on gender, I was able to identify some clear trends and patterns related to skill alignment.<br><br>

I also analyzed how actively students are working on developing skills outside of their curriculum. By comparing this data across genders, I found some interesting differences in participation levels and how students approach extracurricular skill-building.<br><br>

One of the most important parts of my contribution was conducting a correlation analysis to explore the relationship between skill alignment and personal interest. I focused on how these factors impact students' confidence in achieving their career goals. This analysis showed that students who align their degree with their personal interests and skills tend to feel more confident about their future career paths.<br><br>

Through these tasks, I was able to add meaningful insights to our overall analysis, helping us better understand how skill development and confidence levels are connected to student aspirations.<br><br>
</p>
<h5>Muhammed Rinief:</h5>
<p align="justify">
    In this project, my primary contributions revolved around analyzing external influences, personal interest, and their impact on confidence and decision-making in education and career choices. By examining how external recommendations and alternative degree considerations differ across genders, I highlighted significant trends that demonstrate the role of societal and personal influences on students' decisions.<br><br>

My analysis also delved into the relationship between personal interest and confidence levels. The findings revealed that students who chose their degrees based on personal interest exhibited notably higher confidence in achieving their career goals compared to those who did not. This insight underscores the importance of aligning academic pursuits with personal motivations to foster greater engagement and self-assurance.<br><br>

Additionally, I explored how gender impacts receptiveness to external guidance, revealing that female respondents were more influenced by external recommendations and more open to exploring alternative pathways, while male respondents exhibited greater independence and commitment to their initial choices.<br><br>

Through these contributions, I was able to provide key insights into the interplay between external influences, personal interest, and confidence, offering valuable implications for enhancing career counseling strategies and fostering student empowerment in educational and career planning.<br><br>

<h5>A Nimra Tabassum:</h5>
<p align="justify">
    In this report, I contributed significantly to the analysis of gender-related trends in both
educational and career choices.<br><br> Specifically, I assisted in examining the correlation
between gender and the choice of degree programs, identifying key patterns and
trends that highlight how gender influences academic preferences. Additionally, I
played a pivotal role in analyzing the correlation between gender and career choices
post-graduation, providing insights into how gender impacts career trajectories and
workforce participation. <br><br>These analyses were carried out using Excel functions,
including statistical tools such as correlation analysis and data visualization
techniques, to ensure accurate and efficient processing of the data. Based on these
analyses, I helped draw inferences regarding the underlying factors contributing to
gender disparities in education and employment. Furthermore, I contributed to the
organization and structure of the report, ensuring that the findings were clearly
presented and logically ordered, including the numbering and layout of key sections.
<br><br>These contributions were integral in shaping the overall structure and analysis of the
report, which aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of gender-related issues in higher education and professional fields.

<h5>Syed Daeen:</h5>
<p align="justify">
As a member of the team, I was responsible for analyzing the relationship between students' skill alignment with their current degree 
and their engagement in active skill development outside the curriculum.<br><br>
I categorized survey responses by gender to identify trends and used visual representations, such as clustered bar charts, to present the data 
effectively.<br><br>
Additionally, I performed a correlation analysis to explore the connection between skill alignment and personal interest, 
uncovering insights into how students perceive their preparedness for future careers.<br><br>
These contributions highlighted the significance of aligning educational pathways with personal skills to foster confidence in career development.
