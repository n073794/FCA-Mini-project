<h4>4.1 Correlation Between Confidence and Skill</h4>
<h5> 4.1.1 Confidence in Gaining Employment and Achieving Career Goals</h5>

<center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Figure 7: Inference - Pie Chart - Confidence and Skill (YES)</font></i></center><br>
<p align="justify">
    The data reveals a clear correlation between skill alignment and confidence in securing employment. Students who reported that their skills align with their degree (Yes) exhibited significantly higher levels of confidence in gaining employment. These respondents rated their confidence, on average, at around 4.5/5. This suggests that when students feel prepared and equipped for the workforce, their confidence in securing a job is much higher.
    The pattern observed in confidence related to career goals mirrors the trend seen in employment confidence. Students who felt their skills aligned with their degree were significantly more confident in achieving their long-term career goals, with an average confidence rating of 3.5/5. These students believe that their educational background has equipped them with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their chosen careers.

<center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Figure 8: Inference - Pie Chart - Confidence and Skill (SOMEWHAT)</font></i></center><br>
<p align="justify">
    In contrast, students who indicated "Somewhat" alignment displayed moderate confidence (around 3.2/5) in gaining employment, reflecting a more cautious approach. Although these students felt they were somewhat ready for employment, they likely perceived gaps in their skills that led to a more reserved outlook on their job prospects.
    With regards to achieving their career goals, those who indicated "Somewhat" alignment showed moderate confidence levels (4.0/5), again reflecting a certain level of optimism despite recognizing that there might be gaps in their skills. These students likely believe they can still achieve their career goals, albeit with some additional effort or training.
</p> 
<center><img width="60%" src="figures/4.1_3.png"></center><br>
<center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Figure 9: Inference - Pie Chart - Confidence and Skill (NO)</font></i></center><br>
<p align="justify">
    Students who reported "No" alignment with their degree showed the lowest levels of confidence in gaining employment, with an average confidence rating of 2.5/5. This groupâ€™s uncertainty about their skills likely contributed to a lower sense of preparedness, which is reflected in their diminished confidence levels.
    Similarly, Students with "No" skill alignment displayed the lowest confidence in achieving their career goals, with an average rating of 3.0/5. This group likely feels that their lack of alignment between their degree and skills might hinder their ability to reach their career aspirations.
</p>  
<h5>4.1.2 Insights</h5>
<center><img width="60%" src="figures/4.1_4.png"></center><br>
<center><i><font size="2" color="grey">Figure 10: Inference - Combo Chart - Confidence and Skill</font></i></center><br>
<p align="justify">
    The analysis clearly demonstrates a positive correlation between skill alignment and confidence levels. Students who feel their skills align with their degree are significantly more confident in both securing employment and achieving their long-term career goals. In contrast, those with partial or no skill alignment show reduced confidence, highlighting the importance of skills that directly correspond to career expectations.
